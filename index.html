			<h1>JavaScript Fundamentals</h1>
			<p>In this project we'll start at the very beginning and cover everything about the language that a beginner needs to know.</p>
			<hr/>
			<h2>Comments, consoles &amp; alerts</h2>
			<h3>Comments</h3>
			<ol>
				<li>Add text to a file that is ignored by the browser</li>
				<li>Describe the code</li>
				<li>Use sparingly</li>
				<li>Add copyright or license information</li>
				<li>Delineate sections of code</li>
				<li>Two forms of comments:
					<ul>
						<li>Single Line</li>
						<li>Multiline</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
			</ol>
			<h3>The Console</h3>
			<p>console.log() &ndash; the log() method is a member of the console object which is added to the global window object provided by the browser. It's not a part of the underlying JavaScript specification itself.</p>
			<ol>
				<li>Used for debugging</li>
				<li>Check variables or return value of functions</li>
				<li>Available in all modern browsers</li>
			</ol>
			<h3>Alerts</h3>
			<p>alert() &ndash; The alert() method belongs to the global window objects.</p>
			<ol>
				<li>Modal dialog box</li>
				<li>Blocks the browser UI</li>
				<li>Most basic form of debugging</li>
				<li>Objects and arrays cannot be expanded</li>
				<li>Favor console logs over alerts</li>
			</ol>
			<h3>Summary</h3>
			<ul>
				<li>Add single line comments with: // </li>
				<li>Add multiline comments with: /* */</li>
				<li>Log to the console with: console.log()</li>
				<li>Log to an alert with: alert()</li>
			</ul>
			<hr>
			<h2>Variables</h2>
			<ol>
				<li>A container for a value</li>
				<li>JavaScript is weakly/dynamically typed, what this means is that, unlike many other programming languages, when a variable is declared in JavaScript, we don't have to specify what type of value it will store.</li>
				<li>No need to specify variable types</li>
				<li>Variable types can change</li>
				<li>Sometimes we don't know a variable's type</li>
			</ol>
			<p>If we declare a variable without using the var keyword, it will automatically become a global variable, even if it's inside a function. This is very very bad. We should try to avoid setting global variables wherever possible. So never forget the var keyword. It's important that we remember to use the var statement when declaring a value for the first time. If we don't do this, the variable is declared in the global scope, which means that any other JavaScript running on the same webpage can access and update it. This is a very bad thing that can cause unintended consequences for our own code. It can also be the root of incredibly hard to find bugs. To avoid creating globals unintentionally, we usually use a linting tool, like JSLint, which spots errors such as this, and warns us about them.</p>
			<p>When a variable is declared but not assigned a value, it will contain the value of undefined.</p>
			<p>A variable name must start with either an underscore, the dollar sign, or a letter. Numbers can be used within the variable name, but not right at the start. Space characters cannot be used at all.</p>
			<h2>Data Types</h2>
			<ol>
				<li>Loosely typed language</li>
				<li>Few types</li>
			</ol>
			<h3>Primitives</h3>
			<p>The first group of data types, and the most basic are known as the primitives.</p>
			<ol>
				<li>Number</li>
				<li>String</li>
				<li>Boolean</li>
				<li>Undefined</li>
				<li>Null</li>
			</ol>
			<p>Number, String and Boolean are known as the Primary data types whereas, Undefined and Null are known as Special data types.</p>
			<p>In some situations it is treated as the same as the null data type. But in fact, it is no the same. Undefined is not a variable all though it can be used as the value for a variable. Null is a data type that is used in place of any regular value, like a string or a number. Once a variable has been set, it cannot be unset or deleted. But it can have it's value set to null. This is where the null data type is most useful.</p>
			<h4>Number</h4>
			<p>Numbers can be expressed in Octal, Exponential and Hexadecimal format. If we try to use a number outside of a supported range, we'll get plus or minus infinity, which is a special number. If we try to do something invalid to a number, like divide it by a string or something like that, we'll get the value of NaN, which is also another special type of number. Nothing is equal to NaN, not even itself. Use isNan() to check.</p>
			<h4>String</h4>
			<ol>
				<li>A sequence of characters within quotes.</li>
				<li>Can be double or single quotes.</li>
				<li>Quotes can be nested, but the closing and opening quotes should always match</li>
			</ol>
			<h4>Boolean</h4>
			<ol>
				<li>Only two values &ndash; true or false</li>
				<li>JavaScript also has truthy and falsey values</li>
			</ol>
			<p>A falsey value is any of the following values:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>false</li>
				<li>0 (Zero)</li>
				<li>'' (Empty String)</li>
				<li>null</li>
				<li>undefined</li>
				<li>NaN</li>
			</ol>
			<p>All other values are truthy!</p>
			<h3>Composite Data Types</h3>
			<ol>
				<li>Array</li>
				<li>Object</li>
			</ol>
			<h4>Array</h4>
			<ol>
				<li>Container for multiple values</li>
				<li>Arrays are not associative arrays in JavaScript. They are like objects but with fixed numerical indices.</li>
				<li>Indices are zero&ndash;based, so the first item in an array has the index zero.</li>
			</ol>
			<h4>Object</h4>
			<ol>
				<li>Objects are containers for key/value pairs of data.</li>
				<li>Pairs separated by commas</li>
				<li>Key and value separated by colon</li>
				<li>Values can consist of any other data type including other objects and even functions.</li>
				<li>Never put a comma after the last key/value pair</li>
				<li>Values of properties can be accessed using dot notation or bracket notation.</li>
				<li>Objects can be created using object literal syntax. Another way of creating objects is using the new keyword.</li>
			</ol>
			<h4>Summary</h4>
			<p>The different data types that we can use in JavaScript.</p>
			<ol>
				<li>Primitive data types &ndash; Number, String, Boolean, Undefined and Null</li>
				<li>Composite data types &ndash; Array and Object</li>
			</ol>
			<hr>
			<h2>Basic Operators</h2>
			<h4>Arithmetic Operators</h4>
			<ol>
				<li>Plus sign +</li>
				<li>Minus sign -</li>
				<li>Star character *</li>
				<li>Forward Slash /</li>
				<li>Modulus % &ndash; Remainder after dividing two numbers</li>
				<li>Increment ++</li>
				<li>Decrement --</li>
			</ol>
			<h4>Assignment Operators</h4>
			<ol>
				<li>Assignment =</li>
				<li>Addtion Assignment +=</li>
				<li>Subtraction Assignment -=</li>
				<li>Multiplication Assignment *=</li>
				<li>Division Assignment /=</li>
				<li>Modulus Assignment %=</li>
			</ol>
			<h4>Comparison Operators</h4>
			<ol>
				<li>Equality comparison == or === . Always use the  latter i.e. strict equality operator since no type coercion takes place. Not only does the value have to be the same, but the type does, as well. It is recommended to always use strict equality comparison to prevent subtle bugs introduced by JavaScript's type coercion.</li>
				<li>Inequality comparison != or !==</li>
				<li>Greater-than comparison > or >= </li>
				<li>Less-than comparison < or <= </li>
			</ol>
			<h4>Unary and Logical Operators</h4>
			<ol>
				<li>Unary operators: +, -, !, void, typeof, delete</li>
				<li>Logical operators: &&, ||</li>
			</ol>
			<h4>Summary</h4>
			<ol>
				<li>Arithmetic operators: +, -,  *,  /</li>
				<li>Assignment operators: =, +=, -=, *=, /=, %=</li>
				<li>Comparison operators: ==, ===, !=, !==</li>
				<li>Avoid non-strict comparions: ==, !=</li>
			</ol>
			<hr/>
			<h2>Functions</h2>
			<ol>
				<li>A logical grouping of one or more expressions</li>
				<li>Invoked arbitrarily to execute the expressions</li>
			</ol>
			<p>Function expressions are useful and are generally preferred in most situations because of a phenomena known as function hoisting.</p>
			<p>We can also pass functions to other functions as arguments and have the receiving function invoke them. Functions passed to other functions and then invoked like this are known as callback functions.</p>
			<p>Hoisting &ndash; Variables are processed before any other code is executed, so it is advised to always declare variables at the start of the function they are contained within, even if we don't assign them a value. Because variables are processed first, a variable defined halfway down a function is still visible and accessible right at the top of the function. JavaScript hoists it to the top of its scope.</p>
			<p>Just like variables, functions created using the function declaration are evaluated before other code, and so are also hoisted to the top of their scope. Again, this can lead to inconsistent or unexpected results when they are invoked. Function expressions on the other hand, are not hoisted, this is why they are generally preferred.</p>
			<p>Another thing we can do with functions is to define them so that they are invoked automatically. We can do this in several different ways. The first way which is probably the most common, is to wrap them in an extra set of parentheses. Another way to achieve this is to use a unary operator at the start of the function instead of wrapping it in an extra set of parentheses. The second format is sometimes known as leading bang syntax, although any other unary operator is also valid.</p>
			<h4>Summary</h4>
			<ol>
				<li>Use function declarations or function expressions</li>
				<li>Name arguments in parentheses after the function identifier</li>
				<li>Use an extra set of parentheses to invoke immediately</li>
				<li>Function expressions are stored in variables</li>
				<li>Variables and functions are hoisted to the top of their scope</li>
			</ol>
			<hr>
			<h2>Scope</h2>
			<ol>
				<li>Scope defines the visibility/accessibility of variables in different places in the code</li>
				<li>Global scope is the top level scope that contains all other scopes. The global scope in JavaScript is the window object which represents the browser that the code is running in</li>
				<li>Global variables are visible everywhere</li>
				<li>Can be overwritten by other scripts</li>
			</ol>
			<h4>Function scope</h4>
			<ol>
				<li>In JavaScript functions are the only entities that are able to create a new scope.</li>
				<li>Variables created in a function are local to that function. They are local variables instead of global variables.</li>
				<li>Variables defined inside of functions cannot be accessed or updated outside of the function</li>
				<li>Functions can access all their own variables and variables in the same scope as the functions themselves</li>
				<li>Code that creates variables in the global scope is often referred to as leaky code. The variables leak out into the global scope. To avoid this, it's very common to wrap all of our code in an immediately invoked function which creates a local scope for our code. This protects the variables from the global scope.</li>
			</ol>
			<h4>Summary</h4>
			<ol>
				<li>Visibility of variables in our code</li>
				<li>Global variables visible everywhere</li>
				<li>Functions create their own scope</li>
				<li>Local variables only visible to their function</li>
				<li>Exploit this to protect variables from the global scope </li>
			</ol>
